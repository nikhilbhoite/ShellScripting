 sh         Bourne Shell (original UNIX shell)
 bash       Bourne Again Shell (most common)
 zsh        Z Shell (feature-rich)
 ksh        Korn Shell
 csh        C Shell (C-like syntax)

 These files are called shell scripts, typically saved with .sh extension.

 Make Script Executable
 chmod +x hello.sh
 ./hello.sh
