6. Arithmetic Operations

 Basic Arithmetic
 a=10
 b=5
 echo "Sum = $((a + b))"
 echo "Product = $((a * b))"

With expr
 expr $a + $b

Floating-point (with bc)
 echo "scale=2; 5 / 3" | bc

echo "scale=2; 5 / 3"
This part creates the input string for bc.
scale=2 tells bc to keep 2 digits after the decimal point.
5 / 3 is the arithmetic operation you want to compute (division).
So you're asking: what is 5 divided by 3, to 2 decimal places?

| bc
basic calculator
This pipes the input ("scale=2; 5 / 3") into the bc command.
bc is a command-line calculator that supports precision arithmetic.

cat hello.sh

#!/bin/bash
read -p "please type username: " username
echo "Welcome $username Sir!!"
read -p "enter first value: " a
read -p "enter second value: " b
 echo "Sum = $((a + b))"
 echo "Product = $((a * b))"
expr $a + $b
echo "scale=3; $a / $b" | bc


#./hello.sh
please type username: nikhil
Welcome nikhil Sir!!
enter first value: 55
enter second value: 3
Sum = 58
Product = 165
